# yolov3KangarooRoadDetection
Trained from custom labelled data using the Yolov3 Real-Time Object Detection Algorithm. Contains scripts to detect kangaroos and other objects such as cars and bicycles from dash cam footage, live cams, and images.


Requires Python 3.7.9, OpenCV and NumPy.


The work was done in PyCharm community edition 2020.2.3. 


Importing and inputting your images and videos
----------------------------------------------

Save png. jpg. mp4. files in the main project folder. Then run any of the scripts and input the filename (including the extension) in the prompt to begin detecting objects.


Troubleshoot
------------

Please try running directly by double clicking any three of the main scripts (web camera required for Live Camera script). 

Opening and running the script through IDLE may not work since this will not allow the scripts to execute since OpenCV and Numpy libraries are required. 

If the scripts fail to run, try opening IDLE 3.7 application first, then open the script files and run modules. 
Otherwise, opening the folder through PyCharm community edition 2020.2.3 and ensuring libraries are installed should work.
